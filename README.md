# Fake Store API App

This project features a simple, interactive e-commerce interface. 

## Features

The data displayed in this app is being fetched from the Fake Store API. The data is displayed over two pages, and sortable through the search.

### Technology

This project was built with create-react-app. It was intended to demonstrate the use of React Hooks, and the React Context API.

### Attributions

This project started as a demonstration of React Context in the Scrimba Frontend Career Path course on React taught by Bob Ziroll. I added in the API call, changed the hover styling, added the pagination, and the search bar.
